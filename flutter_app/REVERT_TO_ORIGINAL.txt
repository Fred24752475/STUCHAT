✅ REVERTED - iOS 18 Glass UI Removed

All screens have been reverted to their original state.

Glass widget files are KEPT for future use in:
- lib/widgets/glass_button.dart
- lib/widgets/glass_card.dart
- lib/widgets/glass_text_field.dart
- lib/widgets/glass_app_bar.dart
- lib/widgets/glass_background.dart
- lib/widgets/glass_scaffold.dart
- lib/widgets/glass_fab.dart

To use glass UI in the future, simply import these widgets in your screens.

Your app is now back to the original design!
